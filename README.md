## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- SQL Server

### Backend Setup

To set up the backend, first navigate to the backend directory using `cd business-card-app/backend`. Then, restore the NuGet packages with `dotnet restore`. Next, update the connection string in `appsettings.json` to point to your SQL Server instance. Run the migrations to set up the database by executing `dotnet ef database update`, and finally, start the backend server with `dotnet run`. 

### Frontend Setup

For the frontend, navigate to the frontend directory using `cd ../frontend`, and install the necessary dependencies with `npm install`. Start the Angular application by running `ng serve`, and open your browser to `http://localhost:4200`.

## Importing Contacts

Ensure your CSV file is structured as follows: `Name,Email,Phone,Company,Title` with an example entry like `John Doe,john@example.com,123-456-7890,Example Inc,Developer`. For XML, the structure should be: `<contacts><contact><name>John Doe</name><email>john@example.com</email><phone>123-456-7890</phone><company>Example Inc</company><title>Developer</title></contact></contacts>`.

## Generating QR Codes

Each business card will automatically generate a QR code upon saving, allowing it to be scanned for easy access to the cardâ€™s details.
